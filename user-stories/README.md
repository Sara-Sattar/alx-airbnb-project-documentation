# User Stories

This document presents the key user stories derived from the use case diagram of the Airbnb backend system.

These user stories describe the main interactions that the primary actors (User, Host, Admin) have with the system, focusing on their goals and the value they expect to achieve.

## Summary of User Stories

•⁠  ⁠Users can register, log in, search for properties, book accommodations, make payments, and leave reviews.
•⁠  ⁠Hosts can add, edit, and manage their property listings as well as view bookings.
•⁠  ⁠Admins oversee user management, property moderation, and payment monitoring.

This set of user stories will guide the backend development by ensuring that all critical user needs are addressed.
